# architecture test

This repistory contains the java project for coding test named "invert-phrase" for Architecture Exercise
Also, contains architecture diagram as per the given requirements. 
The Advantages of this architecture:

Scalability: The solution is capable of handling high volumes of data. It can also be configured to scale automatically based on demand and traffic.

Reliability: The solution will also ensure the data delivery and reliability.

Cost: The solution can optimize the cost by using serverless services that only charge for what is used. It can also reduce operational overhead and maintenance costs.

Easy Maintenance: The solution can simplify the development and deployment process by using serverless services that do not require server management. Since partner's integrations change infrequently, we can version these Lambda functions to ensure backward compatibility when updates are needed. Each partner can have its dedicated SQS queue therefore adding a new partner is easy and without affecting existing integrations.

Operation management: The solution can monitor and troubleshoot the system by using AWS services that provide metrics, logs, alerts, and dashboards.
